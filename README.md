## Overview of the Project

### Project: Iris Flower Classification

**Objective**:  Classify Iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) using sepal and petal measurements.

**Key Activities**:
1. Load the dataset and explore data patterns.
2. Preprocess data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.
3. Split data into training and test sets.
4. Train a Random Forest Classifier for prediction.
5. Evaluate model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report).

**Technologies**:
- Tools: Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
- Development: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

**Key Insights**:
- Petal features contribute more to classification than sepal features.
- Achieve high accuracy (typically >95%) with models like Random Forest.
- Valuable experience in supervised machine learning workflows.
